 abstract = {RNA-Seq Viewer is a web application that enables users to visualize genome-wide expression data from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The application prototype was created by a small team during a three-day hackathon facilitated by NCBI at Brandeis University. The backend data pipeline was developed and deployed on a shared AWS EC2 instance. Source code is available at https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/rnaseqview.},
