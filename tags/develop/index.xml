      <description>This is a funny story, and I will try to tell you how I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about R in 400 words.
I work at the Bioinformatic Core at Harvard TH School. People who know us, or collaborate with us, knows that we mainly use bcbio to analyze sequencing data (check it out, super cool tool).
Something that we are working on is to load the data after bcbio finishes into R to ease the downstream analysis.</description>
